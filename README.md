## Sentiment Dashboard of COVID-19 Policies

**Overview**: Visualizing Twitter sentiments of COVID-19 policies in the US

The objective of this project is to understand how COVID-19 related government policies affect people’s well-being. This interactive dashboard allows users to visualize how different policy choices in the US affect the overall sentiment of tweets, which were computed using state-of-the-art transformer based methods. A slideable timeline selector allows users to specify the starting and ending dates that the users are interested in. This dashboard also shows daily covid cases and deaths that serves as important indicators of the pandemic situation.
