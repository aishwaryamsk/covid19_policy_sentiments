This visualization was developed as part of a group project for the class Data and Visual Analytics (CSE 6242) with Prof. Polo Chau at the Georgia Institute of Technology. We visualized the sentiments of tweets related to COVID-19 in the US from 2020-2021. The choropleth map shows the average state sentiment towards COVID-19 during the selected period. The range slider allows users to specify the duration they are interested in. 

The objective of this project was to understand how COVID-19 related government policies affected peopleâ€™s well-being. This interactive dashboard allows users to visualize how different policy choices in the US affects the overall sentiments of tweets, which are computed using state-of-the-art transformer-based methods.!
